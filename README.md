This project was made to identify the effects of Climate Change on Crop yields using data processing methodologies with Python pandas, and ML techniques and predictive analysis.
Problem Statement: How can we support farmers in predicting crop yields by understanding how farming practices like pesticide usage, fertilizer application, and organic farming impact their harvests?

The data was taken from several sources, Kaggle, Government Dataset websites, and more. We focused on the Asia region. 

ML applications and what I learnt through this project: 
Model training via data splitting (Test vs Training Data) to be used for evaluation later
Normalisation of data 
Different algorithm models yield differing accuracy for our analysis (Linear Regression, Polynomial Algorithm, Gradient Descent Algorithm)
How to evaluate models (R^2 coefficient, MAE, Intercept, MSE)

Outcome:
Our model was able to accurately predict (to an ~90% accuracy) between predicted and actual crop yields (given factors of pesticide usage, fertiliser application and organic farming), to see how it affects the yields. 
Other tools used for data visualisation and analytics includes: Matplotlib and Seaborn sns. This helped us identify any discrepancies in data. We also removed outliers after studying them, to prevent skewing outcomes.

Note: Trial5_project.ipynb contains our final code submission, I included the previous trials for personal documentation of my journey towards learning and applying ML algorithms and data analytics & visualisation
