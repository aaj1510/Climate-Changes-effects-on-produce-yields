This project was made to identify the effects of Climate Change on Crop yields using data processing methodologies with Python pandas, and ML techniques and predictive analysis.

The data was taken from several sources, Kaggle, Government Dataset websites, and more. We focused on the Asia region. 

How can we support farmers in predicting crop yields by understanding how farming practices like pesticide usage, fertilizer application, and organic farming impact their harvests?
