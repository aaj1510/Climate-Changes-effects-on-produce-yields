# ðŸŒ¾ ML Crop Yield Predictor

This machine learning project was developed to help farmers understand the **impact of agricultural practices**â€”like pesticide usage, fertilizer application, and organic farmingâ€”on **crop yields** in the Asia region. Using real-world datasets and predictive modeling, our team aimed to provide a **data-driven tool** to support better decision-making in agriculture.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

**How can we support farmers in predicting crop yields by understanding how different farming practices affect harvest outcomes?**

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Sources

We compiled agricultural datasets from:
- **Kaggle**
- **Government open data portals**
- **Agricultural research sources** across Asia

The datasets included features such as:
- Pesticide usage (quantitative levels)
- Fertilizer types and quantity
- Organic vs conventional farming practices
- Recorded crop yields

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### ðŸ“‚ Data Processing
- Normalized features to ensure consistency
- Removed outliers after analyzing distribution plots
- Split data into **training** and **testing** sets for model evaluation

### ðŸ¤– ML Models Compared
- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Gradient Descent Algorithm (custom implementation)**

### ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
- **RÂ² Score** (Coefficient of determination)
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Model Intercept/Slopes** for interpretation

---

## ðŸ§ª Results

- Achieved **~90% prediction accuracy** on test data
- Polynomial Regression outperformed Linear in capturing non-linear trends
- Visualized model predictions vs actual yields to identify discrepancies
